                    <td>The <span class="mono">z-index</span> property permits the designation of priority to decide which elements will sit on top of others when they overlap. All positioned elements have their <span class="mono">z-index</span> set to <span class="mono">auto</span> (effectively, zero). Elements with higher integer <span class="mono">z-index</span> values will take precedence over those will lower ones, and will be displayed on top of the latter. </td>

                    <td>If an element has a <span class="mono">z-index</span> of 5, and that this is the highest value for this property compared to other elements, the effect would be no different if it had a <span class="mono">z-index</span> value of 2500. What would matter here is that it has the highest value.</td>

This can be achieved using <span class="mono">top</span>, <span class="mono">bottom</span>, <span class="mono">left</span> and <span class="mono">right</span> properties. It is possible to cause the element in question to overlap with other elements.</td>

The styled element is still considered to be in the normal flow.<br><br>The <span class="mono">top</span>, <span class="mono">bottom</span>, <span class="mono">left</span> and <span class="mono">right</span> properties behave in counterintuitive fashion.</td>

The space where it was will not remain unoccupied, as it can happen with <span class="mono">relative</span> positioning. The element in question will be placed in relation to its containing element.</td>

                    <td>This positioning removes the element in question out of the normal document flow. Some tweaking may be necessary to adjacent elements so they, for example, are not hidden by the fixed element.<br><br>This property can be useful for, for example, fixing a navigation bar to the top of the page so that it remains in view as users scroll down. For this positioning to work correctly, you will need to have layout properties such as <span class="mono">top</span> and <span class="mono">left</span> set.</td>

                    <td>This positioning could, for example, have a nagivation bar move with the page up to a certain point, and thereafter remain fixed as the page continues scrolling.
